Hey there!
Welcome on my personal profile.
Here you can find all my projects and ideas! Take a minute and browse through my work.

## About me
I'm Julian, 20 years old and currently studying cyber-security at DHBW-Stuttgart.
You can find some of those projects here, others are personal ones.
I'm interested in cyber-security, app design and -development and building new skills.


## My Work

### Development

Currently I'm developing native apps for Apple devices using Swift and Swift UI. \
I'm also developing apps and packages with Google's Flutter framework and the underlying language Dart. \
Along with that, I'm improving my native Android development skills with Kotlin.

## UI / UX

I've also got some experience in user interface and user experience design, both with Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/guidelines/overview/) and Google's [Material 3](https://m3.material.io) UI and UX design systems.


## My Setup

Find out what i work with (it's not the setup, but the developer :)).

### Hardware

I'm the minimalistic type of person, so I only use my MacBook for development.  

MacBook:
- 2024 16" MacBook Pro
- M4 Pro CPU with 14 CPU cores and 20 GPU cores
- 1TB GB of storage
- 48 GB of unified RAM

For testing I use the Android emulator that comes with Android Studio and the IOS simulator that comes with Xcode.


### Software

I'm using a lot of different software to develop my apps:
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for iOS and macOS apps (Swift, SwiftUI, ...)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for Android apps (Kotlin, Java, XML, ...)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com)
- [Penpot](https://penpot.app)
- Parallels and Windows for Windows Development


## Organizations

I created a few organizations to sort, manage and group my projects. \
The Jules Media organization contains nearly all my Flutter packages and plugins. \
The school Organization contains all the stuff we are doing in school. (kinda obvious)
